# simple-website-builder-using-prompts
Having just learnt some very basic JavaScript , I have created this little prompt based website creator to get used to the expressions and syntax. Use this tool to create a title, paragraph boxes and other elements all dynamically created

## Description
I have learn how to create elements, select elements and change the styling of elements using JavaScript. This exercise allows a user to enter an H1 title. Once they have, a div with the styling for flex is created. Following this, the user is asked to enter a number of columns to add followed by the text and background colour of each. Any black background will automatically have the text changed to white using a condition.

## Usage

* Enter a heading text
* Enter number of columns to add
* Enter the text to be included in each column
    * Enter the name of the colour as a string i.e. blue, black or hex value i.e. #123245

Validation will not allow the user to enter anything other than an integer into the number of columns
